AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security


GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
My input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
A password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
The password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
